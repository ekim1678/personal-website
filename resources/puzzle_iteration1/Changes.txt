Changes made since last iteration:
- Changed the highlight issue, sprites are now outlined in gray if not selected and in color when selected
- Errors occurred on finishing the final level and resetting and I didn't feel like it was as satisfying because you couldn't see the completed puzzle. Instead you reload if you want to restart.
- Added levels up to Level 8

Other notes:
- Users struggled with selection of pieces the most, and knowing when a sprite was selected. To fix this I changed border highlights and display text.
- There are still some weird visuals with some of the outlines because of Perlenspiel, since I can't have two different colors for different sides of a border
