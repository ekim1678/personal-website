Changes made since last iteration:
- Prompted user to turn on sound; without audio, the toy has much less satisfaction and engagement and the "goal" is
difficult to discover
- Changed volume of corner sounds and "victory" sound due to it being loud compared to the movement sound
- Added column checking functionality; hopefully to reinforce what the "goal" of the toy is

Other notes:
- Most users didn't notice you could drag and drop more than one square, but I felt the visual noise of indicating this
functionality would take away from the experience more than just discovery (and it's not necessary to move a block
more than one space at a time)
- This toy functions kind of like a game as well as a toy. I had feedback that making it more like a true toy might
involve removing the "victory" sounds, but I felt that engagement was higher having a "goal" while still being fun to
mess with if you weren't trying to achieve said "goal"
- Most users didn't realize the "solution" is the cover image.
- All users understood that the corner pieces could not be moved, according to my playtesting survey
